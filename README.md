# Why React Hooks?

This is for my talk
[Why React Hooks?](https://kentcdodds.com/talks/#why-react-hooks)
which is intended to establish a case for why React Hooks
are so useful and you should dedicate some time to learn
about them.

It consists of "slides" in the `./slides` directory and an
example app that's implemented in both classes and hooks.

You can find a recording of the talk

and you can find the deployed app
[here](https://geo-chat.netlify.com/).
